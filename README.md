# Automatic-Water-Bottle-Filling-System-Using-PLC-Programming
The system uses an Omron CP1E PLC to automate bottle detection, filling, labeling, and conveyor control. The goal is to increase production efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and maintain filling accuracy.

 **Problem Statement**

Design an automatic bottle filling and labeling system using an Omron CP1E PLC that detects bottles, fills them to a defined level, applies labels, and resets the system for continuous operation.

 **Software Requirements**

Omron CX-Programmer (for PLC programming)

**System Description**

Bottle detection using sensors

Conveyor motor control

Filling valve operation

Label motor operation

Start–Stop–Reset controls

PLC-based automation logic
