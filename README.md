# Automatic-Water-Bottle-Filling-System-Using-PLC-Programming

This project presents an automated bottle filling and labeling system developed as part of the Internship II Seminar (22ECE158) at BNMIT, Bengaluru.
The system uses an Omron CP1E PLC to automate bottle detection, filling, labeling, and conveyor control. The goal is to increase production efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and maintain filling accuracy.

 **Problem Statement**

Design an automatic bottle filling and labeling system using an Omron CP1E PLC that detects bottles, fills them to a defined level, applies labels, and resets the system for continuous operation.

** Objectives**

To design an automated bottle filling system using Omron PLC

To improve filling accuracy

To reduce manual operation

To enhance consistency and efficiency in the production process

🛠 Software Requirements

Omron CX-Programmer (for PLC programming)

📡 System Description

The system consists of:

Bottle detection using sensors

Conveyor motor control

Filling valve operation

Label motor operation

Start–Stop–Reset controls

PLC-based automation logic

🔧 Methodology

Start the system using a start switch

Bottle arrives at the sensing point

Sensor detects the bottle

PLC activates the filling valve

After filling, PLC activates labeling motor

Conveyor moves bottle to next station

Reset brings system back to initial state
